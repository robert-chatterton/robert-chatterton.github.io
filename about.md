### Academic Background

<p>
  Hello there! Thanks for checking out my website.
</p>
<p>
  My name is <b>Robert Chatterton</b>, and I am a third year Computer Science student enrolled in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. I just recently transferred into becoming a straight Computer Science major, as I was previously a combined Computer Engineering and Computer Science major in the Snell College of Engineering at Northeastern. After taking the foundational courses, I realized that I had fallen in love with the software side of computers so much that I wanted to pursue those interests full time.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently in the process of obtaining a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. AI, machine learning, data science, and computer vision have always stuck out to me as the cutting edge of technology, which is right where I want to be.
