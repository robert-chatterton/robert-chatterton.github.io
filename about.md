<p>
  Hello there! Thanks for checking out my website.
</p>
<p>
  My name is <b>Robert Chatterton</b>, and I am a third year Computer Science student enrolled in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. I just recently transferred into becoming a straight Computer Science major, as I was previously a combined Computer Engineering and Computer Science major in the Snell College of Engineering at Northeastern. After taking the foundational courses, I realized that I had fallen in love with the software side of computers so much that I wanted to pursue those interests full time.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently in the process of obtaining a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. AI, machine learning, data science, and computer vision have always stuck out as right where I want to be, at the cutting edge of technology.

<p>
  I've been a member of Beta Gamma Epsilon Science and Engineering Fraternity since my second semester here at Northeastern. Over that period of time, I've held multiple chairs including Rush, Website/Social Media, and Ceremonies. We do a lot of philanthropic events every semester, notable ones including the Boston Marathon and Head of the Charles, but also smaller events such as Habitat for Humanity days or helping out at local churches/schools.
</p>

<p>
  Throughout my college career, I've done a lot of both school related and personal projects in both programming and engineering. Feel free to check them out
